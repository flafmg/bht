# Better Home & TP (BHT) 🏠

BHT is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance the home teleportation experience for players on Minecraft servers. With BHT, players can set multiple homes, teleport to their homes with ease, and send teleport requests to other players for quick and convenient travel.

## Features 🚀

- **Interactive GUIs**: Seamlessly teleport to homes and manage teleport requests with intuitive graphical user interfaces.
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhance immersion with decorative particles during teleportation, providing visual cues for the process.
- **Vault API Integration**: Integrate with the Vault API for economy plugin support, allowing server owners to charge for teleportation and home services.
- **Customizable Home Limits**: Set custom home limits based on player roles, providing flexibility and control over gameplay experiences.
